🔹 FINAL PROMPT — Sample Code Bank (Mobile App Section)

Role: You are a senior mobile app product designer and backend system architect.

Objective: Design a new “Sample Code Bank” section inside the Profile module of a mobile application used for food safety enforcement and surveillance.

1️⃣ Section Overview

The Sample Code Bank allows officers to generate, manage, assign, and track sample codes for:

Enforcement samples

Surveillance samples

This section must support bulk generation, increment logic, and full usage auditability.

2️⃣ Sample Code Structure

Each sample code is composed of three numeric parts:

Prefix

Middle

Suffix

Each part must support:

Manual numeric input

Independent increment enable/disable

Custom increment value (e.g., +1, +5, +10)

3️⃣ Sample Code Generation Rules

User inputs:

Starting values for Prefix / Middle / Suffix

Which field(s) should increment

Increment value for enabled field(s)

Total number of sample codes to generate

Example:

Prefix = 147 (increment enabled)

Increment value = +1

Quantity = 10

Generated Prefix values: 147 → 156

Middle and Suffix remain unchanged unless increment is enabled.

The system must generate exactly N unique sample codes.

4️⃣ Sample Code Status Management

Each generated sample code must have a status:

Available

Used

Rules:

A sample code can be used only once

Used codes cannot be edited or reused

5️⃣ Usage Tracking & Audit Trail

When a sample code is marked as Used, store and display:

Full sample code

Sample type (Enforcement / Surveillance)

Linked sample reference number

Date & time of use

Officer / user who used the code

Location (if available)

Users must be able to tap a Used code to view complete usage details.

6️⃣ UI / UX Requirements

Location: Profile → Sample Code Bank

Tabs:

Enforcement

Surveillance

Actions:

Generate Sample Codes

View Available Codes

View Used Codes

Filters:

Status (Available / Used)

Date range

Prefix / Middle / Suffix search

7️⃣ Backend & Data Requirements

Prevent duplicate sample codes

Ensure atomic updates when marking a code as Used

Maintain immutable audit logs

Support offline usage with sync conflict handling

Future support for export (PDF / Excel)

8️⃣ Expected Output

Provide:

Database schema / data model

Sample code generation algorithm

API endpoints (create, list, assign, audit)

UI flow or wireframe description

Validation rules and edge cases

Design with scalability, legal compliance, and audit-readiness in mind.
