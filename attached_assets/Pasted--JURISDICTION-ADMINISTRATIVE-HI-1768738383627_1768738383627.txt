JURISDICTION & ADMINISTRATIVE HIERARCHY MANAGEMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------

Build a robust, fully dynamic jurisdiction management system controlled entirely by the Super Admin. Jurisdictions must support configurable administrative hierarchy levels, parent–child relationships, and time-bound officer assignments with role and capacity. No jurisdiction level or structure must be hard-coded.

------------------------------------------------------------------
ADMINISTRATIVE LEVELS (DYNAMIC)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Super Admin must be able to define and manage administrative hierarchy levels.

Each level must have:
- Level Number (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3…)
- Level Name (e.g., State, Municipal Corporation, Zone, District, Circle, Division, Mandal)
- Display Order
- Active / Inactive status

Example configuration (dynamic, editable):
- Level 0: State
- Level 1: Municipal Corporation
- Level 2: Zone
- Level 3: District / Circle
- Level 4: Division
- Level 5: Mandal

Super Admin must be able to:
- Add new levels
- Rename levels
- Disable levels
- Reorder levels
without any code changes.

------------------------------------------------------------------
JURISDICTION UNITS (HIERARCHICAL)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Under each administrative level, Super Admin must be able to create jurisdiction units.

Each jurisdiction unit must have:
- Name
- Code (official reference)
- Administrative Level
- Parent Jurisdiction (self-referencing hierarchy)
- Active / Inactive status

Examples:
- State → Telangana
- District → Hyderabad
- Mandal → Kukatpally
- Zone → North Zone

The system must support:
- Unlimited hierarchy depth
- Parent–child traversal
- Tree-based jurisdiction structure
- Deactivation without data loss

------------------------------------------------------------------
OFFICER ASSIGNMENT TO JURISDICTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------
Officers must be assignable to one or more jurisdiction units using a mapping system.

Each officer–jurisdiction assignment must include:
- Officer
- Jurisdiction Unit
- Role (FSO, DO, FAC, Inspector, etc. – Super Admin controlled)
- Capacity (Regular, In-Charge, FAC, Temporary – Super Admin controlled)
- Start Date
- End Date (optional)
- Active / Inactive status

Assignments must be:
- Time-bound
- Historically preserved for audit
- Non-destructive (no overwriting past assignments)

------------------------------------------------------------------
ASSIGNMENT RULES & ACCESS CONTROL
------------------------------------------------------------------
- An officer may have multiple jurisdiction assignments
- An officer may have different roles or capacities in different jurisdictions
- One primary active jurisdiction must be selectable per login session
- Officers may switch jurisdiction context only if assigned
- All inspections, samples, reports, and documents must be strictly jurisdiction-scoped

------------------------------------------------------------------
SUPER ADMIN DASHBOARD – JURISDICTION MODULE
------------------------------------------------------------------
Super Admin interface must provide:
- Administrative Levels Management
- Jurisdiction Units Management (tree view)
- Officer Assignment Management
- Assignment History & Audit Log
- Bulk Import (Excel/CSV) for jurisdictions and assignments

The UI should support:
- Expand / collapse hierarchy tree
- Search by jurisdiction name or code
- Safe deactivation of units
- Clear visualization of officer coverage

------------------------------------------------------------------
DATA INTEGRITY & AUDIT REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------
- Jurisdiction changes must not affect historical inspections or documents
- All jurisdiction assignments must be logged with timestamps
- Past jurisdiction structures must remain readable for audit and court use
- All generated documents must reference the jurisdiction valid at the time of action

------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------
The jurisdiction system must integrate with:
- Inspection creation
- Sample management
- Workflow rules
- Document generation
- Dashboards and reports

All reports must support aggregation at any jurisdiction level
(State → District → Mandal, etc.).
