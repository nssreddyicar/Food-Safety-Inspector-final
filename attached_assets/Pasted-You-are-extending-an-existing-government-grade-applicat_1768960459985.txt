You are extending an existing government-grade application by enhancing
the COMPLAINT MANAGEMENT module.

The Complaint Form must automatically capture location data, support
evidence uploads, and remain fully dynamic and admin-controlled.
No field, rule, or workflow must be hard-coded.

------------------------------------------------
CORE PRINCIPLE
------------------------------------------------

Complaint submission must be:
- Simple for citizens
- Location-accurate
- Evidence-supported
- Jurisdiction-aware
- Fully auditable

All complaint form fields, validations, and visibility rules must be
controlled from the Super Admin panel using a dynamic form builder.

------------------------------------------------
AUTOMATIC LOCATION CAPTURE
------------------------------------------------

When the complainant opens the complaint link:

1. The system must automatically:
   - Request device location permission
   - Capture current latitude and longitude
   - Capture location accuracy and timestamp

2. The captured data must include:
   - Latitude
   - Longitude
   - Location accuracy (meters)
   - Capture time

3. The location data must:
   - Auto-fill the Incident Location section
   - Be editable only if admin allows manual override
   - Be stored immutably for audit purposes

If permission is denied:
- Allow manual location entry
- Mark location source as "Manual"

------------------------------------------------
COMPLAINT FORM FIELDS (DYNAMIC)
------------------------------------------------

Super Admin must be able to configure the complaint form fields.
Typical fields may include (examples only):

Complainant Details:
- Complainant Name
- Mobile Number (OTP optional)
- Alternate Mobile Number (optional)
- Email (optional)

Incident Details:
- Incident Date & Time
- Incident Location (auto-filled using GPS)
- Latitude & Longitude (read-only by default)
- Nearby Landmark
- Jurisdiction (auto-mapped from coordinates)
- Description of Complaint

Other Person / Accused Details (Optional):
- Name (if known)
- Mobile Number (if known)
- Relationship / Role (dropdown)

------------------------------------------------
PROOF & EVIDENCE UPLOAD
------------------------------------------------

The complaint form must support evidence uploads:

- Photos (camera or gallery)
- Videos (optional)
- Audio (optional)
- Documents (optional)

Rules:
- Multiple uploads allowed
- File size & type configurable by Super Admin
- Each upload must store:
  - File type
  - Upload timestamp
  - GPS metadata (if available)

------------------------------------------------
MOBILE & CONTACT VALIDATION
------------------------------------------------

- Primary mobile number must be validated (OTP optional, admin-controlled)
- Alternate mobile numbers allowed
- Mobile numbers must be masked where required
- Used for status updates if notifications are enabled later

------------------------------------------------
POST-SUBMISSION BEHAVIOR
------------------------------------------------

After complaint submission:
- A unique complaint code is generated
- Complaint status is set to initial admin-configured state
- Jurisdiction is auto-assigned based on GPS/location
- Complaint becomes visible to officers assigned to that jurisdiction

------------------------------------------------
OFFICER VIEW & ACTIONS
------------------------------------------------

Officers must see:
- Complaint location on map (if enabled)
- Latitude & longitude
- Uploaded proofs
- Contact details (as permitted)

Officers can:
- Upload additional photos during field visit
- Update action taken with geo-tagged evidence
- Change complaint status using allowed transitions

------------------------------------------------
COMPLAINANT STATUS TRACKING
------------------------------------------------

Using complaint code, complainant can view:
- Current status
- Status history
- Officer action remarks (if enabled)
- Uploaded evidence (if permitted)

No internal notes or officer identities unless admin allows.

------------------------------------------------
ADMIN CONTROL & CONFIGURATION
------------------------------------------------

Super Admin must be able to configure:
- Which fields are mandatory
- Which fields are visible to complainant
- Which fields are visible to officers
- GPS capture enforcement
- Manual location override
- Evidence limits & formats
- Status workflows & transitions

------------------------------------------------
DATA & AUDIT RULES
------------------------------------------------

- Location data must be immutable once submitted
- All uploads must be traceable
- Complaint history must never be deleted
- Jurisdiction must be stored as per submission time
- GPS vs manual entry must be recorded

------------------------------------------------
SECURITY & PRIVACY
------------------------------------------------

- Location data accessible only to authorised roles
- Personal data masked where required
- Secure file storage for proofs
- Public users cannot modify complaints after submission

------------------------------------------------
FINAL INSTRUCTION
------------------------------------------------

Implement the enhanced Complaint Form as a dynamic, location-aware,
evidence-supported, admin-controlled system.

Do NOT hard-code:
- Form fields
- Location rules
- Validation logic
- Workflow steps

Assume the system will be:
- Used at large government scale
- Maintained by other AI systems
- Audited for legal compliance

Clarity, correctness, and audit safety are mandatory.
